# Hi there visitor👋

### This readme goal is to explain a little about myself and my career for those who do not know me. 

With a career that started in Front-End development, i gained practical experience with React at a retail chain's ecommerce. Aiming to become a Full Stack developer, expanded my skills by working at one of the country's largest private banks to develop and maintain Python APIs and by developing an internal platform with Angular. This experience allowed me to work on different projects necessities, solidifying my ability to transition between front and back-end.

In the beggining of 2023, after leaving my front-end only job (in wich i used this account but in private repos) i begun working for Itaú Unibanco, a huge private bank in Brazil, but this time i got a company owned github account, wich explains my lack of activity here. Although i am willing to assume part of the fault once i did some personal and lots of university projects but ended up not versioning them 😶‍🌫️.

If you read untill this point, know that i intend to try and be more active in github from now on, and if you are an employer, i hope you give me a shot at whateer position is available! 😊

### What i am up to

- Currently building my own website and studying for an AWS certification.
- (Plus trying to find some older projects to upload)
